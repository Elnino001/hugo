<b>Sovereign Guarantees</b>
<p>Sovereign government guarantees are Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC) issued by a designated commercial bank in the subject foreign country at the direction of authorized government officials. Government’s irrevocable, unconditional commitment for loan repayment to its designated issuing bank and the Lender’s bank secures the issuance of SBLC.</p>
<p>Central banks may authorize the issuance of sovereign guarantees but do not generally issue guarantees directly. Some sovereign government guarantees must be “confirmed” by major, foreign banks due to adverse economic conditions in those countries.</p>

<br>
Assignments of guarantees cannot be accepted. <br>

<b>Loan Terms and conditions are offered after the applicant has sent a Letter of Intent and described the type or collateral that is offered.</b>
