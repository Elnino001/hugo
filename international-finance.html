<p>HUGO BRIS ADVISORY has developed a streamlined process of evaluating our interest in projects ( a project can be an idea, product or service or anything else a client requires our assistance in, hereinafter referred to as the “Project”). An executive summary on the project should be submitted to AUDRIC DARENSBOURG ADVISORY for evaluation. In the event that more information is required, it will be requested before a decision is made as to whether or not we are interested in the project and whether it suits our scope of interest. Upon review of the submitted information and AUDRIC DARENSBOURG ADVISORY confirming their interest in participating we will reply to the client with an invitation to meet with a member of our team for a meeting to discuss the requirements, goals and objectives.</p>
